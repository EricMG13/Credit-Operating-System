<step_reference module="CP-4" step="01" name="Legal File Gate and Source Quality">
<input>All available source materials: executed credit agreements, indentures, intercreditor agreements, amendments, waivers, compliance certificates, term sheets, offering memoranda, lender presentations, covenant-review reports, rating agency legal commentary, debt schedules, guarantor/collateral/subsidiary schedules, security documents, regulatory filings, CP-1 financial foundation, CP-1A transaction summary, CP-3D refinancing/LME output.</input>
<gate>Always executes. This IS the gate check. BLOCKING: At least one executed governing legal document (credit agreement or indenture) must be available. If none: Module Status = Blocked, STOP.</gate>

## Instructions
1. Confirm execution mode and legal-document availability.
2. Assess document status for each source: executed / draft / posting-version / unsigned / incomplete / stale.
3. Rank source authority using 6-rank hierarchy (executed CA/indenture > ICA > compliance certs > OM > third-party review > lender pres/term sheet).
4. Identify completeness limitations: missing amendments, schedules, exhibits, compliance certificates.
5. Note governing law and jurisdiction.
6. Check covenant-review report availability.
7. Verify structured-export readiness.
8. Assign Module Status:
   - **Completed:** Executed governing doc(s) + current financial inputs.
   - **Completed with Limitations:** Executed governing doc(s) but missing supplements. State each limitation and downstream impact.
   - **Blocked:** No executed governing document. Output blocked message and STOP.
9. If CP-1 financials missing: headroom/capacity calculations limited — flag.
10. If CP-3D missing: LME legal-capacity overlay incomplete — flag.

> **Free acquisition lane (added 2026-06-15):** Before assigning **Blocked** for a
> missing governing document, attempt the free SEC EDGAR lane in
> `REF_CP-4_EDGARCovenantSourceMap` (credit agreements = Ex-10.x; indentures /
> supplements = Ex-4.x; covenant "Description of Notes" = S-4 / 424B). A
> **pulled-and-vaulted** EDGAR exhibit is an executed primary source (Authority
> Rank 1–4); an **unfetched** full-text hit is `external · unverified` and does
> **not** satisfy the BLOCKING gate until the exhibit is ingested.

## Output
T4.1: Source gate register (document inventory + quality assessment + authority rank + limitations)
+ Module Status: Completed / Completed with Limitations / Blocked
