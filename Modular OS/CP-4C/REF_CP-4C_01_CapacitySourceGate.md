## Instructions
1. Confirm execution mode and required input availability.
2. Check: CP-4 output available? Executed legal documents available? CP-1 financial inputs available? Usage data available?
3. Assess legal formula availability, current financial input availability, usage data availability, and source quality.
4. Verify structured-export readiness.
5. Assign Module Status:
   - **Completed:** Legal formulas + current financial inputs + usage data all available.
   - **Completed with Limitations:** Legal formulas available but missing financial inputs, usage data, compliance certificates, or CP-4 output is itself limited.
   - **Blocked:** No executed governing document AND no CP-4 output. Output blocked message and STOP.
6. If CP-1 financials missing: headroom/capacity calculations limited — flag.
7. If CP-4 output missing or limited: legal provision extraction may be incomplete — flag.

## Output
